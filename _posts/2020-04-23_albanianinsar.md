With COVID isolation continuing, I’ve returned to a topic that has interested me for a long time: synthetic aperture radar (SAR), and more specifically SAR interferometry (InSAR). InSAR is a great tool for measuring small ground displacements that can result from earthquakes, landslides, or subsidence into cavities such as those left behind by oil and gas exploration. There are a number of SAR satellites in operation currently, but I’ll be using freely accessible data from the ESA’s Sentinel-1 platform. As a first toy problem, I decided to look at the site of the [earthquake that hit Albania last year](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019_Albania_earthquake){:target="\_blank"} on November the 26th. The steps I take are largely based on [this ESA tutorial document](http://step.esa.int/docs/tutorials/S1TBX%20TOPSAR%20Interferometry%20with%20Sentinel-1%20Tutorial_v2.pdf){:target="\_blank"}.
