With COVID isolation continuing, Iâ€™ve returned to a topic that has interested me for a long time: synthetic aperture radar (SAR), and more specifically SAR interferometry (InSAR). InSAR is a great tool for measuring small ground displacements that can result from earthquakes, landslides, or subsidence into cavities such as those left behind by oil and gas exploration. There are a number of SAR satellites in operation currently, but I'll be using freely accessible data from the ESA's Sentinel-1 platform.
