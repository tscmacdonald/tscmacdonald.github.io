  abstract = {The apparent “boosted mobility” observed by Wang et al. (Reports, 31 July 2020, p. 537) is the result of a known artifact. When signal intensities are changing during a nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) diffusion measurement for reasons other than diffusion, the use of monotonically increasing gradient amplitudes produces erroneous diffusion coefficients. We show that no boosted molecular mobility is observed when shuffled gradient amplitudes are applied.},

  abstract = {Abstract Intriguing reports of enhanced diffusion in enzymes and molecular catalysts have spurred significant interest in experimental and theoretical investigations, and the mechanism of this phenomenon is the topic of lively debate. Here we use time-resolved diffusion NMR methods to measure the diffusion coefficients (D) of small molecule species involved in chemical reactions with high temporal resolution. We show the enhanced diffusion of small molecules cannot be explained by reaction velocity, and that apparent measurements of enhanced diffusion by small molecules appear to be caused by bulk fluid flow processes such as convection.},

  abstract = {Dihydrogen phosphate anions are found to spontaneously associate into anti-electrostatic oligomers via hydrogen bonding interactions at millimolar concentrations in DMSO. Diffusion NMR measurements supported formation of these oligomers, which can be bound by photoswitchable anion receptors to form large bridged assemblies of approximately three times the volume of the unbound receptor. Photoisomerization of the oligomer-bound receptor causes a decrease in diffusion coefficient of up to 16\%, corresponding to a 70\% increase in effective volume. This new approach to external control of diffusion opens prospects in controlling molecular transport using light.},

  abstract = {A chemical system is proposed that is capable of amplifying small optical inputs into large changes in internal composition, based on a feedback interaction between switchable fluorescence and visible-light photoswitching. This system would demonstrate bifurcating reaction kinetics under irradiation and reach one of two stable photostationary states depending on the initial composition of the system. This behavior would allow the system to act as a chemical realization of the flip-flop circuit, the fundamental element in sequential logic and binary memory storage. We use detailed numerical modeling to demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed behavior based on known molecular phenomena and comment on some of the conditions required to realize this system.},
