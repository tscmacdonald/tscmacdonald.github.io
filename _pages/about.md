I'm a researcher in physical chemistry with interests in supramolecular assembly, molecular photophysics, and molecular implementations of logic and computing. I study these things with a combination of theoretical modelling and experimental spectroscopy, with particular emphasis on method development and application in magnetic resonance (both NMR and ESR). 

I completed my chemistry PhD in 2020, working with [Jon Beves](https://bevesgroup.wordpress.com/), and since then have been working as a postdoctoral fellow with [Dane McCamey](https://www.science.unsw.edu.au/our-people/dane-mccamey) funded by the ARC Centre of Excellence in Exciton Science.

My non-professional interests include English folk music and dance, films, digital technology, and open source intelligence (particularly remote sensing).
