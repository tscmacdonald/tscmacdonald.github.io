I'm a researcher in physical chemistry with interests in supramolecular assembly, molecular photophysics, and molecular implementations of logic and computing. I study these things with a combination of theoretical modelling and experimental spectroscopy, with particular emphasis on method development and application in magnetic resonance (both NMR and ESR). 

My PhD (2016â€“2020) work was with [Jon Beves](https://bevesgroup.wordpress.com/) at the UNSW School of Chemistry, where I studied different approaches to controlling [molecular](https://dx.doi.org/10.1002/anie.201910968) and [supramolecular](https://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jacs.0c09072) transport in solution. This work was largely in physical organic chemistry, with extensive use of diffusion NMR spectroscopy (including [method development](https://dx.doi.org/10.1002/cphc.201900150)) to characterise these processes. I also did some (largely theoretical) work modelling the characteristics of [an original design for a self-amplifying molecular-photonic logic device](https://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpclett.0c03497).

Since 2020 I have been employed as a postdoctoral fellow with [Dane McCamey](https://www.science.unsw.edu.au/our-people/dane-mccamey) at the UNSW School of Physics, funded by the ARC Centre of Excellence in Exciton Science. This work follows two main strands: 
* Theoretical exploration of the possibilities of using excitonic processes for logic and information processing
* Experimetnal electron spin resonance (ESR) characterisation of exotic high-spin multiexcitons resulting from singlet fission

My non-professional interests include English [folk music](https://tscmacdonald.github.io/projects/sheffieldcarols/) and dance, films, digital technology, and open source intelligence (particularly remote sensing).
